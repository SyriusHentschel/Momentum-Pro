# Momentum Pro - Deployment Plan

## 1. Pre-Deployment Preparation

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create production `.env` file with correct values
- [ ] Update authentication redirect URLs for production
- [ ] Configure Supabase project for production use
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration for production domains

### Build Optimization
- [ ] Enable production mode in Vite config
- [ ] Optimize asset sizes (images, CSS, JS)
- [ ] Configure proper caching headers
- [ ] Set up code splitting for better performance

### Final Testing
- [ ] Run final tests in a production-like environment
- [ ] Verify all functionality works with production settings
- [ ] Check for any console errors or warnings
- [ ] Validate HTML, CSS, and accessibility

## 2. Deployment Process

### Build Process
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to create production build
- [ ] Verify build output in `dist` directory
- [ ] Check bundle size and optimize if necessary

### Hosting Setup
- [ ] Choose hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
- [ ] Configure hosting settings (domain, environment variables)
- [ ] Set up continuous deployment from GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure custom domain if applicable

### Deployment Steps
1. Push final code to GitHub repository
2. Trigger build on hosting platform
3. Verify deployment was successful
4. Check application functionality on production URL

## 3. Post-Deployment Tasks

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with production URL and setup instructions
- [ ] Document deployment process for future reference
- [ ] Create user documentation if necessary

### Maintenance Plan
- [ ] Establish process for future updates
- [ ] Set up staging environment for testing changes
- [ ] Create backup strategy for database
- [ ] Plan for regular dependency updates

## 4. Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues after deployment:

1. Identify the issue and its severity
2. If critical, revert to previous working version
3. Fix the issue in development environment
4. Test thoroughly before redeploying
5. Document the issue and solution for future reference
